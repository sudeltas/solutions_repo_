# Problem 2
#üåÄ Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum

#üìå Motivation
The forced damped pendulum illustrates how the simple motion of a pendulum becomes drastically more complex when damping and external forcing are introduced. These interactions give rise to phenomena such as:

#Resonance
##A phenomenon where a system oscillates at maximum amplitude when driven at its natural frequency.

#Quasiperiodic Motion
##Motion that results from the combination of two or more incommensurate frequencies, leading to a complex but non-chaotic behavior.

#Chaos
##A state of unpredictable, irregular motion that occurs when a system is highly sensitive to initial conditions, often seen when driving forces are close to resonant frequencies.

#Applications of this model span:
Climate Systems: Understanding complex cycles and feedback loops within climate dynamics.

##Oscillating Circuits: Used in electrical engineering, particularly in resonance circuits.

##Energy Harvesting: Devices like piezoelectric generators, where oscillating systems harvest energy from environmental vibrations.

##Structural Dynamics: Studying vibrations and oscillations in structures such as bridges, buildings, and mechanical systems.

üß† 1. Theoretical Foundation

üîß Governing Equation
The equation of motion for a forced, damped pendulum is:
$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \gamma \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \sin(\theta) = A \cos(\omega t)
$$
Where:

$\theta(t)$: Angular displacement

$\gamma$: Damping coefficient

$\omega_0$: Natural frequency $(\omega_0 = \sqrt{g/L})$

$A$: Amplitude of the driving force

$\omega$: Driving frequency

‚úÖ Small-Angle Approximation

If $\theta$ is small:
$$
\sin(\theta) \approx \theta
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \gamma \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = A \cos(\omega t)
$$
This is a linear second-order differential equation solvable using standard methods (e.g., undetermined coefficients).
