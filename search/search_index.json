The problem is straightforward: analyze how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Yet, beneath this simplicity lies a complex and versatile framework. The equations governing projectile motion involve both linear and quadratic relationships, making them accessible yet deeply insightful. What makes this topic particularly compelling is the number of free parameters involved in these equations, such as initial velocity, gravitational acceleration, and launch height. These parameters give rise to a diverse set of solutions that can describe a wide array of real-world phenomena, from the arc of a soccer ball to the trajectory of a rocket. 1. Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion describes the trajectory of an object launched into the air, subject only to gravity in the idealized case. We start with Newton\u2019s second law to derive the governing equations, assuming no air resistance. Derivation of Equations of Motion We consider a projectile launched with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the horizontal, with gravity acting downward ( \\(a_y = -g\\) ). Coordinate System and Initial Conditions X-axis : Horizontal direction (positive rightward). Y-axis : Vertical direction (positive upward). Initial velocity components: \\(v_x(0) = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) \\(v_y(0) = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) Initial position: \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)\\) . Equations of Motion The only force is gravity, acting along the y-axis ( \\(a_y = -g\\) ), with \\(a_x = 0\\) . Horizontal Motion (constant velocity): $$ \\frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2} = 0 \\quad \\text{(no acceleration in x-direction)} \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = v_0 \\cos\\theta $$ Integrating: [ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t ] Vertical Motion (constant acceleration): $$ \\frac{d^2 y(t)}{dt^2} = -g \\frac{dy(t)}{dt} = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t $$ Integrating again: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ These are the parametric equations of motion, forming a parabolic trajectory. Family of Solutions The parameters ( \\(v_0, \\theta, g\\) ) define a family of solutions: - Initial Velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) : Higher \\(v_0\\) increases the parabola\u2019s width and height. - Angle ( \\(\\theta\\) ) : Affects the balance between horizontal and vertical components. - Gravity ( \\(g\\) ) : Stronger gravity compresses the trajectory vertically. 2. Analysis of the Range The horizontal range \\(R\\) is the distance traveled when the projectile returns to \\(y = 0\\) . Range Derivation Set \\(y(t) = 0\\) : [ 0 = (v_0 \\sin\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] [ t \\left( v_0 \\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 ] Solutions: \\(t = 0\\) (launch) or \\(t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) (landing). Substitute into \\(x(t)\\) : \\[ R = x\\left(\\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\right) = (v_0 \\cos\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} = \\frac{2 v_0^2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta}{g} \\] Using \\(2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = \\sin 2\\theta\\) : $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} $$ Dependence on Angle ( \\(\\theta\\) ) Maximum range at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) ( \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 1\\) ): \\(R_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{v_0^2}{g}\\) . \\(R = 0\\) at \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) or \\(90^\\circ\\) . Complementary angles (e.g., \\(30^\\circ\\) and \\(60^\\circ\\) ) yield the same range. Influence of Other Parameters Initial Velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) : \\(R \\propto v_0^2\\) . Gravity ( \\(g\\) ) : \\(R \\propto \\frac{1}{g}\\) . 3. Practical Applications Sports : Optimizing a basketball shot or golf ball flight. Engineering : Designing artillery or water fountains. Astrophysics : Approximating low-altitude satellite trajectories. Extensions Uneven Terrain : Adjust landing condition for height \\(h\\) . Air Resistance : Add drag force, solve numerically. 4.

Trajectory Plot : Displays the parabolic path for \\(v_0 = 15 \\, \\text{m/s}, \\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . 5. Discussion Limitations Assumes no air resistance, flat terrain, and constant gravity. Real-world trajectories deviate due to drag and wind. Suggestions Drag : Add a \\(-k v\\) term and solve numerically. Wind : Include a horizontal force. Terrain : Adjust \\(y(t)\\) for variable ground height. This analysis and simulation highlight projectile motion\u2019s elegance and adaptability, bridging theory and application across diverse fields. Explanation of Changes Theoretical Foundation : The derivation now exactly matches your friend's screenshot, including the use of \\frac for fractions in the equations (e.g., \\(\\frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2}\\) , \\(\\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\) ). Consistency : Ensured that the notation and structure align with the screenshot while maintaining clarity in English. Simulation Code : Kept the corrected Python script from the previous response, ensuring it runs without errors. Outputs : Described the graphical outputs as required. Discussion : Included limitations and suggestions for extensions, addressing real-world factors like drag and wind.
